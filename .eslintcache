Popa and McDowell (2011) suggested that increasing the computational COD requirement reduces behavioral variability in a virtual organism animated by the ETBD. The present paper further investigated a wide range of computational COD values and used the results to formulate predictions about the effects of COD requirements on the behavioral variability of humans in concurrent-schedules environments. As predicted by ETBD, the rate of switching between alternatives was systematically decreased by increased COD requirements. These results provide further support for the ETBD as a valid account of behavior dynamics, showing that it is not only able to produce outcomes congruent with known behavior statics (the Matching Law; McDowell & Popa, 2010), but it can also formulate predictions about the behavior of live organisms. Moreover, these findings suggest that high behavioral variability may be a natural outcome of the selection pressure exerted by unstructured environments.

Complex systems are dynamic, adaptive systems, composed from a large number of interconnected parts, and governed by simple, low-level rules that can give rise to novel, emergent features or behaviors. High-level, emergent properties are not readily reducible to the rules that produce them. They appear to be stand-alone entities and behavioral and psychological sciences have traditionally studied them as such (e.g. impact of divorce on children's risk of depression). However, if they are emergent features of a dynamic system, the relations between them cannot, in principle, be causal (divorce → depression). Their co-occurrence is incidental, both being produced by underlying simple rules reiterated over long periods of time. In order to fully understand an emergent property, one must identify the rules that govern the system and the specific conditions under which the property emerges (McDowell & Popa, 2009). This implies a complete shift in focus, from high-level properties to low-level rules and characteristics, opening a fascinating doorway for scholars interested in the behavior of organisms.\",\n        img: [ABAI_2013_01_slide, ABAI_2013_05_slide, ABAI_2013_Popa_McDowell_Calvin_1],\n        urls: [{ name: \"ABAI 2013\", link: \"https://www.abainternational.org/events/program-details/event-detail.aspx?sid=28880&by=ByArea#s166_0\" }, ],\n        citation: \"Popa, A., Calvin, N., & McDowell, J J.

The theory causes a population of behaviors to evolve through time under the selection pressure of the environment. It has been tested under a variety of conditions and the emergent outcomes were repeatedly shown to be qualitatively and quantitatively indistinguishable from those displayed by live organisms (McDowell, in press). As empirical evidence accumulates and our understanding of the theory matures, the analogy between biological and behavioral evolution becomes more compelling. Expanding the exploration of this analogy becomes both necessary and fascinating. The main purpose of this project was to explore the effects of mutation and the environment's value and conduciveness on various dimensions of behavioral variability, in continuous choice environments. Secondly, qualitative predictions made by the Evolutionary Theory about the effects of changeover delays (COD) on behavior variability were verified against the behavior of college students in equivalent environments. The continuous choice behavior of college students was correctly predicted on eight out of eight behavioral dimensions. Thirdly, low-level characteristics of students' continuous choice behavior were compared with traditional measures of impulsivity and sustained attention, in an effort to investigate the potential equivalence between mutation and a property of the nervous system that produces impulsivity-like symptoms. The results were inconclusive, likely due to a lack of extreme impulsivity scores in the human sample. The findings presented in this paper provided significant additional evidence for the selectionist account as a valid mechanism of behavior change. In addition, the knowledge generated by the Evolutionary Theory provided important insights about clinically-relevant phenomena, such as disordered variability (or impulsivity) and raise the possibility of using the theory as a platform for simulating the emergence of specific high-level phenotypes. These implications appear even more fascinating considering that a connection with mental health was not explicitly sought, nor can it be traced to the inner-workings of the theory. This challenges our current understanding of mental illness and provides a new way of thinking about the evolution of behavioral repertoires and their emergent high-level characteristics.\",\n        img: [ phd_committee , etbd_adhd_slide_1],\n        urls: [\n            { name: \"Emory ETD\", link: \"https://etd.library.emory.edu/concern/etds/9880vr10s?locale=en\" },\n            { name: \"ProQuest\", link: \"xxxx\" },\n            { name: \"Study info\", link: \"gDrive\" },\n         ],\n         citation: \"Popa (2013).

The theory causes a population of behaviors to evolve through time under the selection pressure exerted by the environment. It has been tested under a variety of conditions and the emergent outcomes were repeatedly  shown to be qualitatively and quantitatively indistinguishable from those displayed by live organisms (McDowell, in press). The present project investigated the effects of various environmental variables (e.g. reward magnitude) on the behavior variability of virtual organisms characterized by various mutation rates. High mutation rates produced behavioral constellations similar to those displayed by ADHD-diagnosed children. These effects were counteracted by arranging richer or more structured environments (higher changeover delay). Interestingly, arranging low-value environments caused organisms characterized by low mutation rates to display abnormally high levels of variability. These findings suggest that similar high-level phenotypes such ADHD may be caused by various combinations of organismic and environmental features (equifinality), during a dynamic process governed by Darwinian forces.\",\n        img: [ABAI_2014_Chicago, ABAI_2014_Andrei],\n        urls: [{ name: \"ABAI 2014\", link: \"https://www.abainternational.org/events/program-details/event-detail.aspx?sid=40586&by=ByArea#s30_0\" }, ],\n        citation: \"Popa, A., Calvin, N., & McDowell, J J.

The purpose of this project was to explore the effects of high mutation rates on behavioral variability in environments that arranged different reinforcer rates and magnitudes. Behavioral variability increased with the rate of mutation. High reinforcer rates and magnitudes reduced these effects; low reinforcer rates and magnitudes augmented them. These results are in agreement with live-organism research on behavioral variability. Various combinations of mutation rates, reinforcer rates, and reinforcer magnitudes produced similar high-level outcomes (equifinality). These findings suggest that the independent variables that describe an experimental condition interact; that is, they do not influence behavior independently. These conclusions have implications for the interpretation of high levels of variability, mathematical undermatching, and the matching theory. The last part of the discussion centers on a potential biological counterpart for the rate of mutation, namely spontaneous fluctuations in the brain’s default mode network.\",\n        img: [],\n        urls: [\n            { name: \"JEAB\", link: \"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jeab.199/abstract\" },\n            { name: \"ResGate\", link: \"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299382923_Behavioral_variability_in_an_evolutionary_theory_of_behavior_dynamics\" },\n        ],\n        citation: \"Popa, A., & McDowell, J, J.
