The evolutionary theory was tested by comparing the steady-state behavior it generated on concurrent schedules to the description of steady state behavior provided by modern matching theory. Ensemble fits of modern matching theory that enforced its constant-k requirement and the parametric identities required by its equations, accounted for large proportions of data variance, left random residuals, and yielded parameter estimates with values and properties similar to those obtained in experiments with live organisms.

The results showed that improved performance in concurrent-schedules performance (e.g. increased sensitivity to reinforcement, reduced rate of switching, etc.) under high levels of mutation is attainable by increasing the rate or magnitude of the reinforcement and/or the COD requirement; the results accurately parallel those reported in the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder literature (Kollins, Lane, and Shapiro, 1997; Aase and Sagvolden, 2006; Taylor, Lincoln, and Foster, 2010), indicating that mutation is the computational equivalent of impulsivity.\",\n    img: [ABAI_2011_event],\n    urls: [\n      {\n        name: \"ABAI 2011\",\n        link: \"https://www.abainternational.org/events/program-details/event-detail.aspx?sid=13494&by=ByArea#s445_0\",\n      },\n    ],\n    citation:\n      \"Popa, A., & McDowell, J J.

Popa and McDowell (2011) suggested that increasing the computational COD requirement reduces behavioral variability in a virtual organism animated by the ETBD. The present paper further investigated a wide range of computational COD values and used the results to formulate predictions about the effects of COD requirements on the behavioral variability of humans in concurrent-schedules environments. As predicted by ETBD, the rate of switching between alternatives was systematically decreased by increased COD requirements. These results provide further support for the ETBD as a valid account of behavior dynamics, showing that it is not only able to produce outcomes congruent with known behavior statics (the Matching Law; McDowell & Popa, 2010), but it can also formulate predictions about the behavior of live organisms.

Complex systems are dynamic, adaptive systems, composed from a large number of interconnected parts, and governed by simple, low-level rules that can give rise to novel, emergent features or behaviors. High-level, emergent properties are not readily reducible to the rules that produce them. They appear to be stand-alone entities and behavioral and psychological sciences have traditionally studied them as such (e.g. impact of divorce on children's risk of depression). However, if they are emergent features of a dynamic system, the relations between them cannot, in principle, be causal (divorce → depression). Their co-occurrence is incidental, both being produced by underlying simple rules reiterated over long periods of time. In order to fully understand an emergent property, one must identify the rules that govern the system and the specific conditions under which the property emerges (McDowell & Popa, 2009).

In other words, the ability to affect the dynamic of neuronal activation states implies the ability to interfere with one's perception, thought, and action (live, as it happens), and - by extension - with the individuality that emerges over time (Popa, 2019).\",\n    img: [change_in_state_2],\n    urls: [\n      //{ name: \"PsyArXiv\", link: \"https://psyarxiv.com/m87an/\" },\n      //{name: \"ResGate\",link: \"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335688963_Psychology_20_The_Emergence_of_Individuality\",},\n    ],\n    citation:\n      \"Expert Panel, Neurotechnologies that Penetrate the Mind, Georgia Institute of Technology (2013)\",\n  },\n\n  {\n    id: 16,\n    title: \"Complexity, Darwinism, and the Emergence of High-Level Phenotypes\",\n    date: \"12/24/2013\",\n    type: \"doctoral dissertation\",\n    keywords: [\"Doctor of Philosophy\", \"dissertation\", \"education\", \"deggree\"],\n    tags: [\"synthetic data\", \"human data\"],\n    role: \"PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR\",\n    description:\n      \"... The main purpose of this project was to explore the effects of mutation and the environment's value and conduciveness on various dimensions of behavioral variability, in continuous choice environments. Secondly, qualitative predictions made by the Evolutionary Theory about the effects of changeover delays (COD) on behavior variability were verified against the behavior of college students in equivalent environments. The continuous choice behavior of college students was correctly predicted on eight out of eight behavioral dimensions. Thirdly, low-level characteristics of students' continuous choice behavior were compared with traditional measures of impulsivity and sustained attention, in an effort to investigate the potential equivalence between mutation and a property of the nervous system that produces impulsivity-like symptoms. The results were inconclusive, likely due to a lack of extreme impulsivity scores in the human sample. The findings presented in this paper provided significant additional evidence for the selectionist account as a valid mechanism of behavior change. In addition, the knowledge generated by the Evolutionary Theory provided important insights about clinically-relevant phenomena, such as disordered variability (or impulsivity) and raise the possibility of using the theory as a platform for simulating the emergence of specific high-level phenotypes. These implications appear even more fascinating considering that a connection with mental health was not explicitly sought, nor can it be traced to the inner-workings of the theory. This challenges our current understanding of mental illness and provides a new way of thinking about the evolution of behavioral repertoires and their emergent high-level characteristics.\",\n    img: [\n      phd_committee,\n      etbd_adhd_slide_1,\n      phd_etbd_humans_1,\n      phd_etbd_humans_2,\n    ],\n    urls: [\n      {\n        name: \"Emory ETD\",\n        link: \"https://etd.library.emory.edu/concern/etds/9880vr10s?locale=en\",\n      },\n      // { name: \"ProQuest\", link: \"xxxx\" },\n      { name: \"Study info\", link: \"gDrive\" },\n    ],\n    citation:\n      \"Popa (2013).

The theory causes a population of behaviors to evolve through time under the selection pressure exerted by the environment. It has been tested under a variety of conditions and the emergent outcomes were repeatedly  shown to be qualitatively and quantitatively indistinguishable from those displayed by live organisms (McDowell, in press). The present project investigated the effects of various environmental variables (e.g. reward magnitude) on the behavior variability of virtual organisms characterized by various mutation rates. High mutation rates produced behavioral constellations similar to those displayed by ADHD-diagnosed children. These effects were counteracted by arranging richer or more structured environments (higher changeover delay). Interestingly, arranging low-value environments caused organisms characterized by low mutation rates to display abnormally high levels of variability. These findings suggest that similar high-level phenotypes such ADHD may be caused by various combinations of organismic and environmental features (equifinality), during a dynamic process governed by Darwinian forces.\",\n    img: [\n      ABAI_2014_Chicago,\n      ABAI_2014_Andrei,\n      abai_2014_slide1,\n      abai_2014_slide2,\n    ],\n    urls: [\n      {\n        name: \"ABAI 2014\",\n        link: \"https://www.abainternational.org/events/program-details/event-detail.aspx?sid=40586&by=ByArea#s30_0\",\n      },\n    ],\n    citation:\n      \"Popa, A., Calvin, N., & McDowell, J J.

The purpose of this project was to explore the effects of high mutation rates on behavioral variability in environments that arranged different reinforcer rates and magnitudes. Behavioral variability increased with the rate of mutation. High reinforcer rates and magnitudes reduced these effects; low reinforcer rates and magnitudes augmented them. These results are in agreement with live-organism research on behavioral variability. Various combinations of mutation rates, reinforcer rates, and reinforcer magnitudes produced similar high-level outcomes (equifinality). These findings suggest that the independent variables that describe an experimental condition interact; that is, they do not influence behavior independently. These conclusions have implications for the interpretation of high levels of variability, mathematical undermatching, and the matching theory.

When a previously reinforced behavior suddenly becomes ineffective, it will eventually disappear from an organism’s repertoire. Its extinction, however, is often preceded by an extinction burst: a short-lived period of frenetic activity, during which the targeted behavior increases in frequency, intensity, and variability, and often accompanied by the presence of novel behaviors. The effects of extinction on behavioral variability have been mostly investigated in the context of positively reinforced behaviors. In this paper, we explored its effects on the frequency and variability of negatively reinforced human behavior. Extinction caused a ten-fold increase in behavior frequency, high changeover frequency, a surge in the frequency of extraneous behavior, and higher inter-response variability, in both time and space. These results suggested, among other things, that negatively reinforced behavior was inherently variable, that behavioral novelty observed during extinction may have had little adaptive potential (if any), and that negative reinforcement may have stifled exploratory tendencies.\",\n\n    fig_captions: [\n      \"The figure illustrates the participants’ visual experience during the experiment.

However, the model does not explain how these variables interact with each other or how, exactly, they contribute to a specific outcome. I submit to the reader a potential explanation. Drawing on theoretical advancements from the field of complex systems and on computational research on the dynamics of behavioral repertoires (McDowell, 2013; Popa, 2013; Popa & McDowell, 2016), the theory discussed here proposes that the interaction between agents and their environment consists of a continuous-choice process during which agents adapt to environmental changes. This process molds an individual’s context (e.g., income, culture, etc.) into robust collections of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral manifestations like “impulsivity”, “authoritative parent”, etc. The factors typically associated with impulsivity (for example) contribute to its emergence indirectly, by altering the relative value of existing options, and, by extension, the moment-to-moment probability of choosing one course of action over another. High-level phenotypes, therefore, cannot be directly explained by the contributing factors themselves, but by the moment-to-moment changes said factors produce in cognition and action.\",\n    // img: [ABAI_2017_1, ABAI_2017_2, ABAI_2017_3, ABAI_2017_4, ABAI_2017_5, ABAI_2017_6, ABAI_2017_7, ABAI_2017_8, ABAI_2017_9, ABAI_2017_10],\n    img: [ABAI_2017_5, ABAI_2017_6],\n    urls: [\n      {\n        name: \"ABAI 2017\",\n        link: \"https://www.abainternational.org/events/program-details/event-detail.aspx?sid=53139&by=ByArea#s196_0\",\n      },\n      {\n        name: \"Conference schedule\",\n        link: \"https://www.abainternational.org/events/annual-2017.aspx\",\n      },\n    ],\n    citation:\n      \"Popa, A., (2017).

In ETBD, high mutation rates caused symptoms similar to textbook descriptions of ADHD and they were more severe when the Hamming Changeover Delay was low. A similar effect was shown in ADHD-diagnosed children: they did poorly without a COD, but did okay with a 3-seconds COD (they had to wait 3 seconds after switching between activities; Taylor et al, 2010).<br/><br/>So I thought to run partcipants in similar conditions - with and without a COD - and to compare the results to their scores on ADHD inventories and laboratory measures. I expected that the students with higher ADHD scores will do worse in concurrent schedules without a COD and better when the COD was 2 seconds. <br/><br/> The variation in ADHD scores in the sample was too low to detect potential effects, but by this time I already had what I wanted, and more. The experimental procedure captured the difference between the No-COD and COD-2s conditions very well. At the same time, after analyzing the data produced by ETBD, I figured out how different combinations of mutation, selection, and Hamming COD work at molecular level to produce ADHD-like symptoms in ETBD. This led me to propose that ADHD is an emergent property of disrupted neuronal dynamics and that mutation may have a counterpart in the  brain's Default Mode Network (DMN).\"\n            />\n\n            <h2 className=\"chapter-sub-title\">\n              Fast matching procedures: portals between the dynamics of\n              behavior, cognition, and brain function\n            </h2>\n\n            <ReadMoreHook\n              maxChars={300}\n              overview=\"The reason I made Fast Matching was to verify ETBD predictions and to learn more about human behavior.

This includes the “matching equations”, known to describe the overall relation between responses and reinforcers with great accuracy, and across species (for a review, see McDowell, 2013a). These equations were used to assess the behavior generated by ETBD. ❤ In McDowell and Popa (2010) we showed that when reinforcement rate varied (constant reinforcer magnitude), choice behavior was described in quantitative detail by Baum’s (1974) power function matching equation.  ❤ In McDowell, Popa, and Calvin (2012) we showed that when both reinforcement rate and magnitude varied, choice behavior was well described by the bivariate (or generalized) matching equation (Baum & Rachlin, 1969; reviewed by Cording, McLean, & Grace, 2011).  ❤ In Popa & McDowell (2016) we showed that the assumption of relativity that underlies matching theory did not hold for ETBD data. This was congruent with some live data and in contradictions with others, becoming a prediction of ETBD.  ❤  ❤  ❤  Note that in all studies, the equations explained most of the variance (pVAF > 98%) and yielded parameter values indistinguishable from those observed in live organisms. <span className='star'>&#9734</span> Note also that these outcomes emerged, unguided, from the reiteration of Darwinian rules, providing support for the evolutionary account of behavior dynamics.\";\n */\n\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport parse from \"html-react-parser\";\nimport ReadMoreHook from \"./ReadMoreHook\";\nimport CollapseHook from \"./CollapseHook\";\n\nclass Chapter1 extends Component {\n  render() {\n    var skills = [\n      \"Excel/VBA\",\n      \"syntethic data\",\n      \"research design\",\n      \"experimental control\",\n      \"hypothesis testing\",\n      \"exploratory analysis\",\n      \"ensemble fitting\",\n      \"residual analysis\",\n      \"model selection\",\n      \"regression\",\n    ];\n\n    var Skills = skills.map((s) => {\n      return <label>{s}</label>;\n    });\n\n    return (\n      <div id=\"ch1\" className=\"chapter\">\n        <div className=\"chapterRow\">\n          <div className=\"chapterCol\">\n            <h1 className=\"chapter-title\">Learning, ETBD, and Me</h1>\n            <span className=\"spanYears\">2007 - 2010 </span>\n            <p className=\"p-left\">\n              In August 2007 I joined Dr. McDowell's lab of experimental\n              behavior analysis, where I studied the dynamics of choice and\n              preference in digital and human agents.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"p-left\">\n              For the first three years I worked exclusively with synthetic data\n              produced by ETBD - a computational implementation of the\n              Skinnerian analogy between positive reinforcement and natural\n              selection (Skinner, 1981; McDowell, 2004).

The emerging patterns are then compared with those exhibited by living agents under similar experimental conditions.<br/> <br/>For these comparisons to be meaningful, the variables and rules that make ETBD must map on the real world. <i>Selection</i>, for example was shown to be functionally equivalent to positive reinforcement, which means that numbers and ranges are also suitable representations of operant responses and operant classes, espectivelly.\"\n            />\n\n            <h2 className=\"chapter-sub-title\">\n              Hamming Distances, class similarity,\n              <br /> and Changeover Delays\n            </h2>\n\n            <ReadMoreHook\n              maxChars={300}\n              overview=\"<i>You know when you click a button and it takes a while to load?

An effective strategy for preventing switching from being reinforced is to attach a cost to it, often in the form of a <i>changeover delay</i>, or COD: a few seconds during which reinfrocement is not available. <br/><br/>For my masters project, I explored a possible COD counterpart in ETBD, namely the Hamming Distance that separates the target classes. My findings revealed a complex relation between the structure of the target classes and their location on the continuum of integers (Popa, 2009; Popa & McDowell, 2010). <br/> Subsequent analyses on the same data showed that COD-like effects depend on the Hamming Distances between each operant and every other operant in the two target classes. <br/><br/>Essentially, the relation provides a measure of the overall genotypic similarity between the target classes: the average number of bits for a behavior in one class to change over to the “other” class (Popa, 2013; pp.19-21; figure 4, page 111).\"\n            />\n\n            {/* <h2>Disrupted Neuronal Activity as Formal Cause for ADHD</h2>\n              <ReadMoreHook\n                maxChars={500}\n                style={{ backgroundColor: \"#02aab0\" }}\n                overview=\"The idea was to leverage what I learned about Hamming Distances to explore the connection between <i>mutation</i> and ADHD. In ETBD, high mutation rates caused symptoms similar to textbook descriptions of ADHD and they were more severe when the Hamming Changeover Delay was low. A similar effect was shown in ADHD-diagnosed children: they did poorly without a COD, but did okay with a 3-seconds COD (they had to wait 3 seconds after switching between activities; Taylor et al, 2010).\n  \n  <br/><br/>So I thought to run partcipants in similar conditions - with and without a COD - and to compare the results to their scores on ADHD inventories and laboratory measures. I expected that the students with higher ADHD scores will do worse in concurrent schedules without a COD and better when the COD was 2 seconds. \n \n <br/><br/> The variation in ADHD scores in the sample was too low to detect potential effects, but by this time I already had what I wanted, and more. The experimental procedure captured the difference between the No-COD and COD-2s conditions very well. At the same time, after analyzing the data produced by ETBD, I figured out how different combinations of mutation, selection, and Hamming COD work at molecular level to produce ADHD-like symptoms in ETBD. This led me to propose that ADHD is an emergent property of disrupted neuronal dynamics and that mutation may have a counterpart in the  brain's Default Mode Network (DMN).  \"\n              /> */}\n\n            {/* <p\n                style={\n                  {\n                    //fontFamily: \"Montserrat\",\n                    //color: \"#ccfee7\",\n                    //color: \"#e5e5e5\",\n                  }\n                }\n              >\n                <span\n                  style={{\n                    fontFamily: \"Montserrat\",\n                    //color: \"#ccfee7\",\n                    color: \"#f2fbef\",\n                    fontWeight: \"600\",\n                    marginRight: \".5rem\",\n                    fontSize: \"13px\",\n                  }}\n                >\n                  O.R.D.E.R. and Social Entanglement\n                </span>\n                My appreciation for mentorship was instilled in me since grad\n                school, when I had the privilege of holding an interdisciplinary\n                teaching fellowship called O.R.D.E.R.
