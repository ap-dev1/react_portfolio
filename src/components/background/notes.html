    In ETBD, behavior is produced by Darwinian-like rules; therefore, learning in biological organisms may result from
    Darwinian-like rules as well.</p>

<p style={{ color: '#fff' }}>To verify ETBD, one must map its parameters on properties of the real world. Take
    selection, for example. McDowell, Caron, Kulubekova, & Berg (2008; received 09/2007) showed that changes in the
    frequency and strength of selection events influence ETBD behavior just like changes in reinforcement rate and
    reinforcer magnitude influence the behavior of biological agents. Therefore, selection in ETBD may be a suitable
    representation of positive reinforcement.</p>

<p className='basicText222'> The quantitative analysis of behavior generated a wealth of fine-grained knowledge about
    operant behavior. This includes the “matching equations” - shown to describe the overall relation between responses
    and reinforcers with great accuracy and across species. Such descriptors make suitable criteria for verifying
    computational theories of behavior change.</p>

<p className='basicText222'>In McDowell and Popa (2010) we showed that when reinforcement
    rate varied, choice behavior was described in quantitative detail by Baum’s (1974) power function matching equation.
    In McDowell, Popa, and Calvin (2012) we showed that when both reinforcement rate and magnitude varied, choice
    behavior was well
    described by the bivariate matching equation (Baum & Rachlin, 1969; reviewed
    by Cording, McLean, & Grace, 2011). In both cases, the equations explained most of the
    variance preference patterns (pVAF > 98%) and yielded parameter values for sensitivity to
    reinforcement rate and magnitude indistinguishable from those observed in live organisms. These outcomes emerged,
    unguided, from the reiteration of Darwinian rules, providing support for the evolutionary account of behavior
    dynamics.</p>

<p className='basicText'><i>The everyday is filled with distractions that can interfere with activities that require
        sustained effort. One solution is to make switching between activities more difficult. A common practice is to
        arrange a changeover delay (COD; Findley, 1958): a short interval contingent on switching behavior, during which
        all reinforcers are withheld (hence delayed). This is known to decrease the frequency of changeovers and to
        increase sensitivity to relative reinforcement rates.</i></p>

<p className='basicText'>For my master’s project, I showed that a computational variable (Popa & McDowell, 2010; see
    also Popa, 2013, p. 19-21) is functionally equivalent with the changeover delay (COD) arranged in experiments with
    living organisms. Subsequent analysis high values produced fewer changeovers and higher sensitivity to reinforcement
    (and vice-versa). In this document, I denote this variable with COMP COD (HD COD). </p>


{/* <p>In the model, each emission, or response, triggers a Darwinian cycle. After selection and recombination create a
    new population, it is affected by mutation : a certain percent of behaviors, referred to as mutation rate , is
    randomly selected and “mutated”: one bit in its “genotype”, chosen at random, is “flipped” from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1.
    Previous work, some of which was presented at ABAI (2011), suggested that high mutation rates may produce behavioral
    characteristics that could be described as impulsive . The first specific aim of my dissertation project was to
    explore the effects of various mutation rates, under different environmental conditions, on variability and
    organization of choice behavior.</p> */}








{/* <p>High mutation rates produced severely disorganized behavior, strikingly similar to those
    observed in ADHD-diagnosed children: “...decreased sensitivity to reward, switched more often between activities,
    engaged less often in continuous-responding, abandoned the task faster, took longer to re-engage, acquired fewer
    resources, exhibited high levels of topographic variability... ” (from Popa, 2013, p. 42). Similar to the behavioral
    symptoms observed in ADHD, the disorganized behavior produced by high mutation rates were counteracted in “good
    environ” and worsened in “bad” environs (p. 43-46).</p> */}

{/* <h3>From mutation rate to ADHD and brain function</h3> */}

{/* <p>These findings led me to hypothesize that mutation rate may be functionally equivalent to
    the level of spontaneous fluctuations in the brain’s default-mode network (DMN; Raichle
    et. al., 2001), recently shown to be associated with high levels of intra-individual
    variability (Buckner et. al., 2008; Weissman et. al., 2006) and to interfere with goal-
    directed activity (ref). This hypothesis can be explored by recording brain activity while
    the participant is engaged in continuous choice-behavior. The experimental procedure would have to be short enough
    to be used in conjunction with brain-investigation technologies (e.g., EEG, ERP, fMRI), but long enough to produce
    high frequencies of responses and reinforcing events.</p> */}










    <p>For the second part of my project I programed and tested a “virtual operant chamber”. I arranged a continuous-choice environ in which five concurrent schedules, each in effect for only 200 seconds, scheduled very high reinforcement rates (e.g., 100 reinforcers/minute). One group of students experienced a 2-seconds changeover delay (COD_2s); the second group did not (No_COD). Their choice behavior was compared along the same eight behavioral dimensions used to explore behavioral variability in the computational model.</p>

    <p>When a two-second COD was contingent on switching, behavioral variability noticeably lower than in the No_COD condition. This provided further support for the equivalence between COMP COD and COD and showed that computational models can be used to predict human
    behavior (Popa, 2013, p. 59 - 60). Furthermore, behavior was relatively well described by the power function matching equation (COD_2s; a ~ 0.7, b ~ 1.0, pVAF ~ 75%), despite the short experimental duration and very high reinforcement rates.</p>

    <h3>From computational models to brain function, via fast-paced procedures</h3>

    <p>My findings, unique at the time of their publication, suggest that fast-paced procedures
    can be used to explore equivalences between computational variables and properties of
    the nervous system. For example, if mutation rate and the level of spontaneous
    fluctuations in the brain’s default mode network (DMN) are functionally equivalent, then
    choice-behavior that correlates with high levels of DMN fluctuations should match that     produced by high mutation rates, as discussed in Popa & McDowell (2016).</p>


    "My advisor tried for years, but his theoretical approach was incorrect (McDowell & Klapes, 2019). Judging by the alternative they proposed, he gave up looking for the answer, building it directly in the computations instead. Whatever the answer will be, it has to come in the the form of a low-level mechanism that meets the following conditions: has a conceptual equivalent in evolutionary thought, a functional equivalent in learning, and produces behavioral patterns similar to those of living agents, under similar conditions. McDowell decided on the desired outcomes and identified combinations of existing variables that produce those outcomes. He then used that information to create a set of mathematical operations that he strapped to ETBD and used it to stir the evolutionary process towards the desired outcomes. Because the desired outcome was a decrease in behavior frequency and because the only mechanism for punsihment he can envision is the inverse of selection, he built this appendix around mutation and reinforcement rates, but did not discuss its connection to evolution, aversion, or ETBD."
