        abstract: "In A New Kind of Science, Stephen Wolfram recommends abandoning traditional scientific analysis and the continuous mathematical description that it affords in favor of the study of simple rules. He focuses on amachine known as a cellular automaton as the prototype generator of complex phenomena such as those we see in nature. The simplest cellular automaton consists of a row of cells, each existing in one of two states. The states of the cells are updated from moment to moment by simple rules. Wolfram shows that these machines and their many variations can generate a host of outcomes ranging from very simple to extremely complex.He argues that among these outcomes representations of all the phenomena in the universe will be found, including presumably the behavior of organisms. The output of cellular automata can be mapped to behavior by considering, for example, one of the states of a cell to represent the emission of a behavior. For some cellular automaton rules, these mappings generate cumulative records and inter-response time distributions that are similar to those produced by live organisms. In addition, at least one cellular automaton generates the Herrnstein hyperbola as an emergent outcome. These results suggest that Wolfram’s program and its mainstream version, which is known as complexity theory, is worth pursuing as a possible means of understanding and accounting for the behavior of organisms.",

        abstract: "McDowell (2004) instantiated the Darwinian principles of selection, recombination, and mutation in a computational model of selection by consequences. The model forces a population of behaviors to evolve under the selection pressure of the environment, by applying low-level Darwinian principles; it has been tested under a variety of conditions and the quantitative outcomes are remarkably similar to those obtained in experiments with live organisms (McDowell et al., 2008). The computational model animates a virtual organism with a repertoire of 100 behaviors, represented by binary strings; this raises the specific issue of Hamming distances, the number of digits in a binary string that must be changed in order to obtain another bit string of equal length (Hamming, 1950). McDowell (2008) hypothesized that in environments that reinforce two alternatives the Hamming distance may be computationally equivalent to a changeover delay (COD). In experiments with live organisms that reinforce two alternatives, an interesting phenomenon is sometimes observed: instead of responding to the alternatives, the organism behaves \"as if\" switching itself is reinforced. One way to prevent this phenomenon is the use of a changeover delay, a procedure that prevents the organism from acquiring reinforcement if it switches too often (Findley, 1958). The computational model places the target classes next to each other, and, traditionally, they are separated by a large Hamming cliff, which makes it more difficult for a behavior to switch from one target class to the other. In order to investigate the effects of smaller cliffs between the target classes, they were positioned at different locations along the continuum; in addition, other parameters were systematically varied. Results confirmed McDowell et al.'s Hamming-Distance-As-Changeover-Delay hypothesis and also revealed a robust rule about the effects of Hamming distances within the model. The steady state outcome is, therefore, a product of the reiteration of Darwinian rules, and not an artifact of conveniently choosing an exceptional location for the target classes. This study constitutes another argument for the robustness of the computational model of selection by consequences as a valid account of the behavioral dynamics.",

The evolutionary theory has been shown to generate behavior on single random interval (RI) and concurrent RI RI schedules that has molar properties consistent with matching theory, and that are quantitatively indistinguishable from molar properties of live-organism behavior. At the same time, the theory has been shown to generate molecular inter-response time (IRT) distributions that can be studied in the form of log-survivor plots, and that are similar to log-survivor IRT distributions from live organisms.

The results showed that improved performance in concurrent-schedules performance (e.g. increased sensitivity to reinforcement, reduced rate of switching, etc.) under high levels of mutation is attainable by increasing the rate or magnitude of the reinforcement and/or the COD requirement; the results accurately parallel those reported in the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder literature (Kollins, Lane, and Shapiro, 1997; Aase and Sagvolden, 2006; Taylor, Lincoln, and Foster, 2010), indicating that mutation is the computational equivalent of impulsivity.",

            "Popa and McDowell (2010) showed that the Hamming Distance, a particular mathematical feature of McDowell’s Evolutionary Theory of Behavior Dynamics (ETBD; McDowell, 2004, 2010) is computationally equivalent to the changeover delay (COD; Findley, 1954) used in experiments with live organisms. Popa and McDowell (2011) suggested that increasing the computational COD requirement reduces behavioral variability in a virtual organism animated by the ETBD. The present paper further investigated a wide range of computational COD values and used the results to formulate predictions about the effects of COD requirements on the behavioral variability of humans in concurrent-schedules environments. As predicted by ETBD, the rate of switching between alternatives was systematically decreased by increased COD requirements. These results provide further support for the ETBD as a valid account of behavior dynamics, showing that it is not only able to produce outcomes congruent with known behavior statics (the Matching Law; McDowell & Popa, 2010), but it can also formulate predictions about the behavior of live organisms. Moreover, these findings suggest that high behavioral variability may be a natural outcome of the selection pressure exerted by unstructured environments. The implications for ADHD-symptoms are discussed within the framework provided by previous research (Neuringer, 2010; Taylor et al, 2010).",

Complex systems are dynamic, adaptive systems, composed from a large number of interconnected parts, and governed by simple, low-level rules that can give rise to novel, emergent features or behaviors. High-level, emergent properties are not readily reducible to the rules that produce them. They appear to be stand-alone entities and behavioral and psychological sciences have traditionally studied them as such (e.g. impact of divorce on children's risk of depression). However, if they are emergent features of a dynamic system, the relations between them cannot, in principle, be causal (divorce → depression). Their co-occurrence is incidental, both being produced by underlying simple rules reiterated over long periods of time. In order to fully understand an emergent property, one must identify the rules that govern the system and the specific conditions under which the property emerges (McDowell & Popa, 2009). This implies a complete shift in focus, from high-level properties to low-level rules and characteristics, opening a fascinating doorway for scholars interested in the behavior of organisms.",

        abstract: "The main purpose of this project was to explore the effects of mutation and the environment's value and conduciveness on various dimensions of behavioral variability, in continuous choice environments. Secondly, qualitative predictions made by the Evolutionary Theory about the effects of changeover delays (COD) on behavior variability were verified against the behavior of college students in equivalent environments. The continuous choice behavior of college students was correctly predicted on eight out of eight behavioral dimensions. Thirdly, low-level characteristics of students' continuous choice behavior were compared with traditional measures of impulsivity and sustained attention, in an effort to investigate the potential equivalence between mutation and a property of the nervous system that produces impulsivity-like symptoms. The results were inconclusive, likely due to a lack of extreme impulsivity scores in the human sample. The findings presented in this paper provided significant additional evidence for the selectionist account as a valid mechanism of behavior change. In addition, the knowledge generated by the Evolutionary Theory provided important insights about clinically-relevant phenomena, such as disordered variability (or impulsivity) and raise the possibility of using the theory as a platform for simulating the emergence of specific high-level phenotypes. These implications appear even more fascinating considering that a connection with mental health was not explicitly sought, nor can it be traced to the inner-workings of the theory. This challenges our current understanding of mental illness and provides a new way of thinking about the evolution of behavioral repertoires and their emergent high-level characteristics.",

The theory causes a population of behaviors to evolve through time under the selection pressure exerted by the environment. It has been tested under a variety of conditions and the emergent outcomes were repeatedly  shown to be qualitatively and quantitatively indistinguishable from those displayed by live organisms (McDowell, in press). The present project investigated the effects of various environmental variables (e.g. reward magnitude) on the behavior variability of virtual organisms characterized by various mutation rates. High mutation rates produced behavioral constellations similar to those displayed by ADHD-diagnosed children. These effects were counteracted by arranging richer or more structured environments (higher changeover delay). Interestingly, arranging low-value environments caused organisms characterized by low mutation rates to display abnormally high levels of variability. These findings suggest that similar high-level phenotypes such ADHD may be caused by various combinations of organismic and environmental features (equifinality), during a dynamic process governed by Darwinian forces.",

High reinforcer rates and magnitudes reduced these effects; low reinforcer rates and magnitudes augmented them. These results are in agreement with live - organism research on behavioral variability. Various combinations of mutation rates, reinforcer rates, and reinforcer magnitudes produced similar high-level outcomes(equifinality).These findings suggest that the independent variables that describe an experimental condition interact; that is, they do not influence behavior independently.These conclusions have implications for the interpretation of high levels of variability, mathematical undermatching, and the matching theory.

It was hypothesized that people will work to keep their options open even if it limits acquiring the maximum number of points. Seven Agnes Scott students responded on concurrent Random Interval (RI) schedules of reinforcement. The overall rate of reinforcement was constant, but one target class delivered higher-magnitude reinforcers (5 points vs. 1 point). However, the target class with the lower reinforcer magnitude (1 reinforcer = 1 point) shrank in size when not selected for ten or more consecutive seconds. Every ten-second interval would reduce its size by one fourth of its original size and every new response would increase its size by one fourth (or, if at original size, reset the ten-second interval). Results showed preference for the shrinking class (b ~ 0.9), even though reinforcer magnitude on this class was five times smaller. This suggests that participants preferred to keep their options open, even if meant acquiring a lower overall payoff.",

        abstract: "In concurrent schedule procedures, humans exhibit lower sensitivity to reinforcement than non-humans (McDowell, 2013), possibly because points may not be as reinforcing for humans as food is for non- humans. We hypothesized that an environment that creates the impression of  competition may increase the reinforcing value of points. Two groups of participants (competition vs. non-competition) responded for 18 minutes in a continuous-choice procedure that arranged concurrent, independent Random Interval (RI) schedules; the target classes were invisible to both groups. Preliminary analyses showed that sensitivity to reinforcement, contrary to our hypothesis, was not noticeably higher in the competition condition. These results showed that competition by itself may not be sufficient to increase motivation. Several potential explanations are discussed, including the perceived relevance (or lack thereof) of the activity.",

        abstract: "The purpose of the study was to explore basic properties of choice behavior when the target classes varied in size, in low-discriminability conditions (invisible target classes). 24 Agnes Scott students responded in environments that arranged symmetrical, concurrent, Random Interval (RI) schedules of reinforcement. The target regions (or classes) were hidden. In one condition (N = 12) the target classes were small (about 4% of the experimental area). In the second condition the target classes occupied approximately 20% of the experimental area. Sensitivity to reinforcement was larger when the classes were small ( a ~ 0.70) than when they were large ( a ~ 0.19). The same was true for spatial variability, but not for temporal variability, which was larger when the target classes were small.",

Recent studies on the nature of trypophobia (fear of holes) suggest that specific geometrical arrangements, such as high contrast midrange spatial frequency images, may automatically trigger feelings of discomfort (Cole & Wilkins, 2013). The purpose of this study is twofold: to replicate the findings reported by Cole and Wilkins (2013) and to explore the extent to which the phenomenon can be reversed. Participants will be exposed to similar stimuli as those used by Cole & Wilkins (2013) via a computer program. They will be asked to rate their level of discomfort and provide a short explanation of why. They will then be asked to manipulate the images using (i.e., re-arrange the elements) using the mouse until the level of discomfort decreases. Each resulting image, as well as the stroke paths, will be recorded and analyzed for concurrences of basic geometric shapes and/or arrangements that help reduce anxiety. The overarching goal is to be able to produce personalized visual stimuli that reduce anxiety, thus increasing the level of personalization and effectiveness of therapeutic approaches to anxiety.",

        abstract:
            "When a previously reinforced behavior suddenly becomes ineffective, it will eventually disappear from an organism’s repertoire. Its extinction, however, is often preceded by an extinction burst: a short-lived period of frenetic activity, during which the targeted behavior increases in frequency, intensity, and variability, and often accompanied by the presence of novel behaviors. The effects of extinction on behavioral variability have been mostly investigated in the context of positively reinforced behaviors. In this paper, we explored its effects on the frequency and variability of negatively reinforced human behavior. Extinction caused a ten-fold increase in behavior frequency, high changeover frequency, a surge in the frequency of extraneous behavior, and higher inter-response variability, in both time and space. These results suggested, among other things, that negatively reinforced behavior was inherently variable, that behavioral novelty observed during extinction may have had little adaptive potential (if any), and that negative reinforcement may have stifled exploratory tendencies.",

        abstract:
            "The biopsychosocial model acknowledges that high-level phenotypes (e.g., impulsivity, good at math, etc.) are multiply-caused by a plethora of contributing, interacting factors, such as specific genetic configurations, socio-economic status, culture, ethnicity, gender, and so on.  However, the model does not explain how these variables interact with each other or how, exactly, they contribute to a specific outcome. I submit to the reader a potential explanation. Drawing on theoretical advancements from the field of complex systems and on computational research on the dynamics of behavioral repertoires (McDowell, 2013; Popa, 2013; Popa & McDowell, 2016), the theory discussed here proposes that the interaction between agents and their environment consists of a continuous-choice process during which agents adapt to environmental changes. This process molds an individual’s context (e.g., income, culture, etc.) into robust collections of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral manifestations like “impulsivity”, “authoritative parent”, etc. The factors typically associated with impulsivity (for example) contribute to its emergence indirectly, by altering the relative value of existing options, and, by extension, the moment-to-moment probability of choosing one course of action over another. High-level phenotypes, therefore, cannot be directly explained by the contributing factors themselves, but by the moment-to-moment changes said factors produce in cognition and action.",
