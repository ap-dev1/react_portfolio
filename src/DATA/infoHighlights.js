        abstract: "The main purpose of this project was to explore the effects of mutation and the environment's value and conduciveness on various dimensions of behavioral variability, in continuous choice environments. Secondly, qualitative predictions made by the Evolutionary Theory about the effects of changeover delays (COD) on behavior variability were verified against the behavior of college students in equivalent environments. The continuous choice behavior of college students was correctly predicted on eight out of eight behavioral dimensions. Thirdly, low-level characteristics of students' continuous choice behavior were compared with traditional measures of impulsivity and sustained attention, in an effort to investigate the potential equivalence between mutation and a property of the nervous system that produces impulsivity-like symptoms. The results were inconclusive, likely due to a lack of extreme impulsivity scores in the human sample. The findings presented in this paper provided significant additional evidence for the selectionist account as a valid mechanism of behavior change. In addition, the knowledge generated by the Evolutionary Theory provided important insights about clinically-relevant phenomena, such as disordered variability (or impulsivity) and raise the possibility of using the theory as a platform for simulating the emergence of specific high-level phenotypes. These implications appear even more fascinating considering that a connection with mental health was not explicitly sought, nor can it be traced to the inner-workings of the theory. This challenges our current understanding of mental illness and provides a new way of thinking about the evolution of behavioral repertoires and their emergent high-level characteristics.",

        abstract: "The Spring Annual Research Conference is held at Agnes Scott each April to provide students and faculty with an opportunity to present their work to the campus community.As an interdisciplinary conference, SpARC fosters essential connections across academic disciplines and encourages an ongoing dialogue between the liberal arts and sciences. My mentees (bold font) and I contributed five (5) posters and three (3) talks, counting towards ~15% of all research projects presented at SpARC 2016. Note that all eight were novel contributions to the field. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my former students and research assistants, AlessandraXi Zhangand Olivia Zivot. Without their contribution, managing this enterprise would have been challenging at best.",
