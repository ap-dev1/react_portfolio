Molar and molecular features of behavior are emergent properties of an evolutionary theory of behavior dynamics that instantiates the idea that behavior evolves in response to selection pressure provided by reinforcement from the environment. This theory consists of Darwinian rules of selection, reproduction, and mutation that operate on a population of potential behaviors over time to generate a continuous stream of emitted behavior. The evolutionary theory has been shown to generate behavior on single random interval (RI) and concurrent RI RI schedules that has molar properties consistent with matching theory, and that are quantitatively indistinguishable from molar properties of live-organism behavior. At the same time, the theory has been shown to generate molecular inter-response time (IRT) distributions that can be studied in the form of log-survivor plots, and that are similar to log-survivor IRT distributions from live organisms. A parallel selectionist theory of neural functioning has been discussed as a plausible material mechanism for this evolutionary theory of behavior dynamics.",

This computational theory implements Darwinian principles of selection, reproduction, and mutation, which operate on a population of potential behaviors by means of a genetic algorithm. The behavior of virtual organisms animated by this theory may be studied in any experimental environment. The evolutionary theory was tested by comparing the steady-state behavior it generated on concurrent schedules to the description of steady state behavior provided by modern matching theory. Ensemble fits of modern matching theory that enforced its constant-k requirement and the parametric identities required by its equations, accounted for large proportions of data variance, left random residuals, and yielded parameter estimates with values and properties similar to those obtained in experiments with live organisms. These results indicate that the dynamics of the evolutionary theory and the statics of modern matching theory together constitute a good candidate for a mechanics of adaptive behavior.",

The purpose was twofold: to clarify the parallel between mutation and impulsivity and to explore methods of counteracting the undesired effects of high mutation rates. The results showed that improved performance in concurrent-schedules performance (e.g. increased sensitivity to reinforcement, reduced rate of switching, etc.) under high levels of mutation is attainable by increasing the rate or magnitude of the reinforcement and/or the COD requirement; the results accurately parallel those reported in the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder literature (Kollins, Lane, and Shapiro, 1997; Aase and Sagvolden, 2006; Taylor, Lincoln, and Foster, 2010), indicating that mutation is the computational equivalent of impulsivity.",

    //     abstract: "Complexity science is rapidly becoming the 'spoiled child' of the scientific community, promising to dissolve interdisciplinary barriers and open a new chapter in our understanding of the natural world (Mitchell, 2009). Complex systems are dynamic, adaptive systems, composed from a large number of interconnected parts, and governed by simple, low-level rules that can give rise to novel, emergent features or behaviors. High-level, emergent properties are not readily reducible to the rules that produce them. They appear to be stand-alone entities and behavioral and psychological sciences have traditionally studied them as such (e.g. impact of divorce on children's risk of depression). However, if they are emergent features of a dynamic system, the relations between them cannot, in principle, be causal (divorce → depression). Their co-occurrence is incidental, both being produced by underlying simple rules reiterated over long periods of time. In order to fully understand an emergent property, one must identify the rules that govern the system and the specific conditions under which the property emerges (McDowell & Popa, 2009). This implies a complete shift in focus, from high-level properties to low-level rules and characteristics, opening a fascinating doorway for scholars interested in the behavior of organisms.",

    //     abstract:
    //         "When a previously reinforced behavior suddenly becomes ineffective, it will eventually disappear from an organism’s repertoire. Its extinction, however, is often preceded by an extinction burst: a short-lived period of frenetic activity, during which the targeted behavior increases in frequency, intensity, and variability, and often accompanied by the presence of novel behaviors. The effects of extinction on behavioral variability have been mostly investigated in the context of positively reinforced behaviors. In this paper, we explored its effects on the frequency and variability of negatively reinforced human behavior. Extinction caused a ten-fold increase in behavior frequency, high changeover frequency, a surge in the frequency of extraneous behavior, and higher inter-response variability, in both time and space. These results suggested, among other things, that negatively reinforced behavior was inherently variable, that behavioral novelty observed during extinction may have had little adaptive potential (if any), and that negative reinforcement may have stifled exploratory tendencies.",
