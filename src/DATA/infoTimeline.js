    //         "One theory of behavior dynamics instantiates the idea that behavior evolves in response to selection pressure from the environment in the form of reinforcement. This computational theory implements Darwinian principles of selection, reproduction, and mutation, which operate on a population of potential behaviors by means of a genetic algorithm. The behavior of virtual organisms animated by this theory may be studied in any experimental environment. The evolutionary theory was tested by comparing the steady-state behavior it generated on concurrent schedules to the description of steady state behavior provided by modern matching theory. Ensemble fits of modern matching theory that enforced its constant-k requirement and the parametric identities required by its equations, accounted for large proportions of data variance, left random residuals, and yielded parameter estimates with values and properties similar to those obtained in experiments with live organisms. These results indicate that the dynamics of the evolutionary theory and the statics of modern matching theory together constitute a good candidate for a mechanics of adaptive behavior.",

        abstract: "McDowell and Popa (in press) showed that when running concurrent schedules, experimental settings designed to reasonably sample the reinforcement ratio domain may not adequately sample the absolute reinforcement rate domain.  For example, a concurrent RI 10 RI 20 has a reinforcement ratio of 2:1, equal to a concurrent RI 100 RI 200; evidently, the absolute reinforcement rates differ considerably. McDowell and Popa suggested that the overall absolute reinforcement rate in a concurrent schedule might affect behavior generated by the computational model. Systematic and thorough sampling of the absolute reinforcement rate domain in a series of computational experiments confirmed this hypothesis. <b>The results</b> showed that as the overall absolute reinforcement rate increased, behavior generated by the computational model became less sensitive to changes in parameters related to reinforcer value, changeover delay, and impulsivity.",

        abstract:
            "Popa and McDowell (2010) showed that the Hamming Distance, a particular mathematical feature of McDowell’s Evolutionary Theory of Behavior Dynamics (ETBD; McDowell, 2004, 2010) is computationally equivalent to the changeover delay (COD; Findley, 1954) used in experiments with live organisms. Popa and McDowell (2011) suggested that increasing the computational COD requirement reduces behavioral variability in a virtual organism animated by the ETBD. The present paper further investigated a wide range of computational COD values and used the results to formulate predictions about the effects of COD requirements on the behavioral variability of humans in concurrent-schedules environments. As predicted by ETBD, the rate of switching between alternatives was systematically decreased by increased COD requirements. These results provide further support for the ETBD as a valid account of behavior dynamics, showing that it is not only able to produce outcomes congruent with known behavior statics (the Matching Law; McDowell & Popa, 2010), but it can also formulate predictions about the behavior of live organisms. Moreover, these findings suggest that high behavioral variability may be a natural outcome of the selection pressure exerted by unstructured environments. The implications for ADHD-symptoms are discussed within the framework provided by previous research (Neuringer, 2010; Taylor et al, 2010).",

        abstract: "The main purpose of this project was to explore the effects of mutation and the environment's value and conduciveness on various dimensions of behavioral variability, in continuous choice environments. Secondly, qualitative predictions made by the Evolutionary Theory about the effects of changeover delays (COD) on behavior variability were verified against the behavior of college students in equivalent environments. The continuous choice behavior of college students was correctly predicted on eight out of eight behavioral dimensions. Thirdly, low-level characteristics of students' continuous choice behavior were compared with traditional measures of impulsivity and sustained attention, in an effort to investigate the potential equivalence between mutation and a property of the nervous system that produces impulsivity-like symptoms. The results were inconclusive, likely due to a lack of extreme impulsivity scores in the human sample. The findings presented in this paper provided significant additional evidence for the selectionist account as a valid mechanism of behavior change. In addition, the knowledge generated by the Evolutionary Theory provided important insights about clinically-relevant phenomena, such as disordered variability (or impulsivity) and raise the possibility of using the theory as a platform for simulating the emergence of specific high-level phenotypes. These implications appear even more fascinating considering that a connection with mental health was not explicitly sought, nor can it be traced to the inner-workings of the theory. This challenges our current understanding of mental illness and provides a new way of thinking about the evolution of behavioral repertoires and their emergent high-level characteristics.",

    //     abstract:
    //         "Skinner (1981) suggested that natural selection operates not only at the biological level, but is also responsible for the evolution of behavioral repertoires throughout an organism’s lifetime. McDowell (2004) implemented the selectionist account in a computational theory of behavior dynamics. The theory causes a population of behaviors to evolve through time under the selection pressure exerted by the environment. It has been tested under a variety of conditions and the emergent outcomes were repeatedly  shown to be qualitatively and quantitatively indistinguishable from those displayed by live organisms (McDowell, in press). The present project investigated the effects of various environmental variables (e.g. reward magnitude) on the behavior variability of virtual organisms characterized by various mutation rates. High mutation rates produced behavioral constellations similar to those displayed by ADHD-diagnosed children. These effects were counteracted by arranging richer or more structured environments (higher changeover delay). Interestingly, arranging low-value environments caused organisms characterized by low mutation rates to display abnormally high levels of variability. These findings suggest that similar high-level phenotypes such ADHD may be caused by various combinations of organismic and environmental features (equifinality), during a dynamic process governed by Darwinian forces.",

    //     abstract:
    //         "The biopsychosocial model acknowledges that high-level phenotypes (e.g., impulsivity, good at math, etc.) are multiply-caused by a plethora of contributing, interacting factors, such as specific genetic configurations, socio-economic status, culture, ethnicity, gender, and so on.  However, the model does not explain how these variables interact with each other or how, exactly, they contribute to a specific outcome. I submit to the reader a potential explanation. Drawing on theoretical advancements from the field of complex systems and on computational research on the dynamics of behavioral repertoires (McDowell, 2013; Popa, 2013; Popa & McDowell, 2016), the theory discussed here proposes that the interaction between agents and their environment consists of a continuous-choice process during which agents adapt to environmental changes. This process molds an individual’s context (e.g., income, culture, etc.) into robust collections of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral manifestations like “impulsivity”, “authoritative parent”, etc. The factors typically associated with impulsivity (for example) contribute to its emergence indirectly, by altering the relative value of existing options, and, by extension, the moment-to-moment probability of choosing one course of action over another. High-level phenotypes, therefore, cannot be directly explained by the contributing factors themselves, but by the moment-to-moment changes said factors produce in cognition and action.",
