        description:  "<b>4. Applying cellular automata to behavior (p. 348)</b> <br/><br/> <i>Cellular automata have been used to represent and understand ballistic collisions in particle mechanics, turbulence in fluid flow, the flow of automobile traffic, and the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, which is a non-linear chemical oscillation. Using cellular automata to represent natural phenomena such as these entails mapping features of the output of the machines onto physical properties of the phenomena. In the case of behavior, one possible mapping is to consider each column of the output of a cellular automaton as a series of time ticks (which it is) during which a discrete behavior, such as a lever press, may occur. Some pattern of cells, the simplest being a single black or white cell, can represent an occurrence of the behavior. Successive columns in the output of a cellular automaton may be taken to represent the continuation of an experimental session, or additional sessions, or sessions with different subjects. Given this mapping it is possible to create cumulative records, prepare inter-response time (IRT) distributions, and calculate average response rates from the outputs of cellular automata.<i/>",

This computational theory implements Darwinian principles of selection, reproduction, and mutation, which operate on a population of potential behaviors by means of a genetic algorithm. The behavior of virtual organisms animated by this         theory may be studied in any experimental environment. The evolutionary theory was tested by comparing the steady-state behavior it generated on concurrent schedules to the description of steady state behavior provided by modern matching theory. Ensemble fits of modern matching theory that enforced its constant-k requirement and the parametric identities required by its equations, accounted for large proportions of data variance, left random residuals, and yielded parameter estimates with values and properties similar to those obtained in experiments with live organisms. These results indicate that the dynamics of the evolutionary theory and the statics of modern matching theory together constitute a good candidate for a mechanics of adaptive behavior. ",

Virtual organisms animated by a selectionist theory of behavior dynamics worked on concurrent random interval schedules where both the rate and magnitude of reinforcement were varied. The selectionist theory consists of a set of simple rules of selection, recombination, and mutation that act on a population of potential behaviors by means of a genetic algorithm.An xtension of the power function matching equation, which expresses behavior allocation as a joint function of exponentiated reinforcement rate and reinforcer magnitude ratios, was fitted to the virtual organisms’ data, and over a range of moderate mutation rates was found to provide an excellent description of their behavior without residual trends.The mean exponents in this range of mutation rates were 0.83 for the reinforcement rate ratio and 0.68 for the reinforcer magnitude ratio, which are values that are comparable to those obtained in experiments with live organisms.These findings add to the evidence supporting the selectionist theory, which asserts that the world of behavior we observe and measure is created by evolutionary dynamics.",

        description: "Popa and McDowell (2010) showed that the Hamming Distance, a particular mathematical feature of McDowell’s Evolutionary Theory of Behavior Dynamics (ETBD; McDowell, 2004, 2010) is computationally equivalent to the changeover delay (COD; Findley, 1954) used in experiments with live organisms. Popa and McDowell (2011) suggested that increasing the computational COD requirement reduces behavioral variability in a virtual organism animated by the ETBD. The present paper further investigated a wide range of computational COD values and used the results to formulate predictions about the effects of COD requirements on the behavioral variability of humans in concurrent-schedules environments. As predicted by ETBD, the rate of switching between alternatives was systematically decreased by increased COD requirements. These results provide further support for the ETBD as a valid account of behavior dynamics, showing that it is not only able to produce outcomes congruent with known behavior statics (the Matching Law; McDowell & Popa, 2010), but it can also formulate predictions about the behavior of live organisms. Moreover, these findings suggest that high behavioral variability may be a natural outcome of the selection pressure exerted by unstructured environments. The implications for ADHD-symptoms are discussed within the framework provided by previous research (Neuringer, 2010; Taylor et al, 2010).",

        description: "Complexity science is rapidly becoming the 'spoiled child' of the scientific community, promising to dissolve interdisciplinary barriers and open a new chapter in our understanding of the natural world (Mitchell, 2009). Complex systems are dynamic, adaptive systems, composed from a large number of interconnected parts, and governed by simple, low-level rules that can give rise to novel, emergent features or behaviors. High-level, emergent properties are not readily reducible to the rules that produce them. They appear to be stand-alone entities and behavioral and psychological sciences have traditionally studied them as such (e.g. impact of divorce on children's risk of depression). However, if they are emergent features of a dynamic system, the relations between them cannot, in principle, be causal (divorce → depression). Their co-occurrence is incidental, both being produced by underlying simple rules reiterated over long periods of time. In order to fully understand an emergent property, one must identify the rules that govern the system and the specific conditions under which the property emerges (McDowell & Popa, 2009). This implies a complete shift in focus, from high-level properties to low-level rules and characteristics, opening a fascinating doorway for scholars interested in the behavior of organisms.",

        description: "McDowell (2004) instantiated low-level Darwinian processes in a computational theory of behavior dynamics. The theory causes a population of behaviors to evolve through time under the selection pressure of the environment. It has been tested under a variety of conditions and the emergent outcomes were repeatedly shown to be qualitatively and quantitatively indistinguishable from those displayed by live organisms (McDowell, in press). As empirical evidence accumulates and our understanding of the theory matures, the analogy between biological and behavioral evolution becomes more compelling. Expanding the exploration of this analogy becomes both necessary and fascinating. The main purpose of this project was to explore the effects of mutation and the environment's value and conduciveness on various dimensions of behavioral variability, in continuous choice environments. Secondly, qualitative predictions made by the Evolutionary Theory about the effects of changeover delays (COD) on behavior variability were verified against the behavior of college students in equivalent environments. The continuous choice behavior of college students was correctly predicted on eight out of eight behavioral dimensions. Thirdly, low-level characteristics of students' continuous choice behavior were compared with traditional measures of impulsivity and sustained attention, in an effort to investigate the potential equivalence between mutation and a property of the nervous system that produces impulsivity-like symptoms. The results were inconclusive, likely due to a lack of extreme impulsivity scores in the human sample. The findings presented in this paper provided significant additional evidence for the selectionist account as a valid mechanism of behavior change. In addition, the knowledge generated by the Evolutionary Theory provided important insights about clinically-relevant phenomena, such as disordered variability (or impulsivity) and raise the possibility of using the theory as a platform for simulating the emergence of specific high-level phenotypes. These implications appear even more fascinating considering that a connection with mental health was not explicitly sought, nor can it be traced to the inner-workings of the theory. This challenges our current understanding of mental illness and provides a new way of thinking about the evolution of behavioral repertoires and their emergent high-level characteristics.",

The present project investigated the effects of various environmental variables (e.g. reward magnitude) on the behavior variability of virtual organisms characterized by various mutation rates. High mutation rates produced behavioral constellations similar to those displayed by ADHD-diagnosed children. These effects were counteracted by arranging richer or more structured environments (higher changeover delay). Interestingly, arranging low-value environments caused organisms characterized by low mutation rates to display abnormally high levels of variability. These findings suggest that similar high-level phenotypes such ADHD may be caused by various combinations of organismic and environmental features (equifinality), during a dynamic process governed by Darwinian forces.",

The purpose of this project was to explore the effects of high mutation rates on behavioral variability in environments that arranged different reinforcer rates and magnitudes. Behavioral variability increased with the rate of mutation. High reinforcer rates and magnitudes reduced these effects; low reinforcer rates and magnitudes augmented them. These results are in agreement with live-organism research on behavioral variability. Various combinations of mutation rates, reinforcer rates, and reinforcer magnitudes produced similar high-level outcomes (equifinality). These findings suggest that the independent variables that describe an experimental condition interact; that is, they do not influence behavior independently. These conclusions have implications for the interpretation of high levels of variability, mathematical undermatching, and the matching theory. The last part of the discussion centers on a potential biological counterpart for the rate of mutation, namely spontaneous fluctuations in the brain’s default mode network.",

        description: "ABSTRACT. When a previously reinforced behavior suddenly becomes ineffective, it will eventually disappear from an organism’s repertoire. Its extinction, however, is often preceded by an extinction burst: a short-lived period of frenetic activity, during which the targeted behavior increases in frequency, intensity, and variability, and often accompanied by the presence of novel behaviors. The effects of extinction on behavioral variability have been mostly investigated in the context of positively reinforced behaviors. In this paper, we explored its effects on the frequency and variability of negatively reinforced human behavior. Extinction caused a ten-fold increase in behavior frequency, high changeover frequency, a surge in the frequency of extraneous behavior, and higher inter-response variability, in both time and space. These results suggested, among other things, that negatively reinforced behavior was inherently variable, that behavioral novelty observed during extinction may have had little adaptive potential (if any), and that negative reinforcement may have stifled exploratory tendencies.",

        description: "The biopsychosocial model acknowledges that high-level phenotypes (e.g., impulsivity, good at math, etc.) are multiply-caused by a plethora of contributing, interacting factors, such as specific genetic configurations, socio-economic status, culture, ethnicity, gender, and so on.  However, the model does not explain how these variables interact with each other or how, exactly, they contribute to a specific outcome. I submit to the reader a potential explanation. Drawing on theoretical advancements from the field of complex systems and on computational research on the dynamics of behavioral repertoires (McDowell, 2013; Popa, 2013; Popa & McDowell, 2016), the theory discussed here proposes that the interaction between agents and their environment consists of a continuous-choice process during which agents adapt to environmental changes. This process molds an individual’s context (e.g., income, culture, etc.) into robust collections of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral manifestations like “impulsivity”, “authoritative parent”, etc. The factors typically associated with impulsivity (for example) contribute to its emergence indirectly, by altering the relative value of existing options, and, by extension, the moment-to-moment probability of choosing one course of action over another. High-level phenotypes, therefore, cannot be directly explained by the contributing factors themselves, but by the moment-to-moment changes said factors produce in cognition and action.",

        description: "Unlike biological systems, automata are deterministic systems, governed by precise rules. The question examined here was: what if every new cell has a small probability to be written incorrectly, i.e. to mutate from 0 to 1 or viceversa. ... Low mutation probabilities facilitated the emergence of new patterns and structures, disconnected from the initial conditions.",

        description: "Physical forces acting on particles explain how physical systems change over time. Evolutionary forces acting on populations of genomes explain change in the genetic structure of populations across generations. Change in psychological systems - i.e. human development, or learning - is not yet understood. Although dynamic principles have been proposed, their target remained vaguely defined. What are such principles acting on, what kind of empirical transformations do they cause, and how do these transformations explain development?",
