        content: "My work focuses on the dynamics of continuous decision-making. I approach this question from a complexity theory perspective, using biologically-inspired computational methods and human laboratory studies. In my most recent work 1) I explored the effects of spontaneous variation on the behavior variability of virtual agents and the mediating role of the environment’s value (Popa et. al., 2015) and structure (Popa, 2015a), 2) I showed how computational approaches can inform about the emergence of developmental disorders such as ADHD and how the complexity paradigm can inform on real-world issues (Popa & McDowell, 2015), and 3) I developed a human-friendly version of the continuous-choice procedure used in non-humans that yielded robust results (“good matching”) in under 30 minutes, thus making it possible to directly investigate the neuronal underpinnings of continuous decision-making (Popa, 2015b).
